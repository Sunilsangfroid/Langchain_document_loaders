Rohit Gurunath Sharma, born on April 30, 1987, in Bansod, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India, is a distinguished international cricketer renowned for his elegant batting style and strategic acumen. Raised in a modest household, his father worked as a caretaker in a transport firm, and due to financial constraints, Rohit spent his early years with his grandparents and uncles in Mumbai. His cricketing journey commenced at the age of 12 when he joined a local cricket camp, quickly making a mark with his natural talent.

Rohit's domestic career began with the West Zone in the Deodhar Trophy in March 2005, where he scored an unbeaten 142 against North Zone, bringing him into the national spotlight. He made his One Day International (ODI) debut for India against Ireland on June 23, 2007. Although he didn't bat in that match, he soon showcased his potential with a vital 50 against South Africa during the 2007 ICC World Twenty20. His Test debut came later, on November 6, 2013, against the West Indies, where he scored an impressive 177 runs, the second-highest score by an Indian on Test debut.

Rohit's batting prowess is highlighted by several remarkable records. He is the only cricketer to have scored three double centuries in ODIs, including a world-record 264 against Sri Lanka in 2014. In the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup, he set a tournament record by scoring five centuries, amassing a total of 648 runs, and earning the Golden Bat award. His consistency in ODIs is reflected in his accumulation of over 11,000 runs at an average nearing 49, including 32 centuries and 58 half-centuries.

In the Indian Premier League (IPL), Rohit has been a pivotal figure. He began his IPL career with the Deccan Chargers, winning the title in 2009.

Under his leadership, Mumbai Indians clinched five IPL titles (2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2020), making him one of the most successful captains in the tournament's history.

In Test cricket, Rohit's journey has seen both highs and lows. While he has displayed brilliance in home conditions, his overseas performances have faced scrutiny. As of January 2025, he was omitted from the final Test against Australia, leading to speculations about the future of his Test career. Despite this, he continues to be a vital part of India's limited-overs setup, leading the team to a Champions Trophy victory in March 2025.
